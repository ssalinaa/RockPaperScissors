## About the game

Rock paper scissors is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"), a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.

## Solution

The user has three options:
1. Typing "r" ot "rock" as an input;
2. Typing "p" ot "paper" as an input;
3. Typing "s" ot "scissors" as an input;

The computer automatically chooses a random options, which reveals who is the winner. If there is an invalid input the user has to type another input. 
If the user is a winner it will type the message "You win." otherwise it will print "You lose.". When both inputs are the same, it will print "This game was a draw.".
